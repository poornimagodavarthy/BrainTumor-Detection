# Brain Tumor Detection with XAI and Deep Learning

## Description
This project aims to classify tumor types from the BraTs Dataset utilizing a custom transfer learning approach based on the lightweight MobileNetV2 model. 
By applying Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping), the project provides interpretable visualizations of the classification results. 
Ongoing work includes integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance explainability and improve model accuracy.
